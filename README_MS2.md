## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

The site's primary goal is to help the visitors making great ramen bowls and inspire them to upload and share their own creations with the community. The business goal is to sell recipe books to the website's audience. The site has three target audience:

- Guest users (casual players)
- Registered users (people who already know the game)
- Frequent visitors (people who like the game and want to test their memory)

### Game Rules

 - There are six levels in total.
 - Each level starts with a sequence of world landmarks to memorize.
 - The difficulty is progressive. Level one starts with just one picture, level two with two pictures etc...
 - The user has a few seconds to memorize the sequence.
 - The user needs to match all the elements in order to proceed with the next level.
 - If the user makes a mistake, the game is over.
 - The score is calculated from 0% (game over at level one) to 100% (all answers are correct in level six).

### User stories

  - ### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a Guest User, I want to learn how to play quickly.
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand how long the game is.
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to try to turn on the music.
  

  - ### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to improve my score.
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to send my results via mail or send to friends to show them.
    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find community links.
  

  - ### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to periodically test my memory.
    2. As a Frequent User, I want to be inspired by the setting and choose a location for my next trip.
    3. As a Frequent User, I want to challenge friends to see who has a better visual memory.
  

### UX - Five Planes Method

#### 1. Strategy
  The primary goal is to entertain the user with a quick memory game.
  
#### 2. Scope
  Everything should be easy to understand, and the game should be quick to learn. There aren't any navigation elements, but the user should be able to activate the music anytime, replay the game and share the result with others.

#### 3. Structure
  There is a title screen with a callout image to play the game. There is no need for a navbar since the only purpose is to play the game. After the title screen, there are instructions to teach the user how to play. Then the game starts with level 1 and moves further to level six. If the user makes a mistake or win each level, the ending screen appears. In the ending screen, there is the reward, the score, and the mail form to share the result. 

#### 4. Skeleton
  The game wrapper is the main div containing the title screen and the game screen. The game screen is composed of a progress box, an information box, a game box, and a button box. All the elements are generated in these boxes at runtime. Check the wireframe for more details.

#### 5. Surface
  The game is in flat design to look modern, easy, and fresh. The theme is travel, so the title screen feature a camera and each element to memorize in the game are pictures of world landmarks. Check the design for more details.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

- The palette has been generated with [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

  - Medium Slate Blue: #7f7eff
  - Sky Blue Crayola: #76e5fc
  - Atomic Tangerine: #f29559
  - Black: #000000

#### Typography

- "Comfortaa" is the main font used throughout the whole website, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
- "Ribeye" is a clean font used for headings.

#### Imagery
- Imagery is important. The game is in flat design. The images are without borders, and the image under the title is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

});
```

```
#element {
    margin-right: auto;

}
```
